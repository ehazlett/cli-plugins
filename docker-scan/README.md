# Container Scanning
Docker Scan can analyze containers for common, potential misconfigurations.  The following are currently checked:

- Privileged: are any containers running as privileged
- Published All Ports: do any containers have all ports published
- Host Mounts: are any containers bind mounting volumes from the host
- Cap Add: have any containers been launched with additonal capabilities

Usage

```bash
$> docker scan containers
ID            IMAGE			RUNNING  PRIVILEGED  PUBLISHEDALLPORTS  HOSTMOUNTS  CAPADD
